## 🛠 Project Pipeline (Roadmap)

I'm building this in my spare time between lectures. Here is what's on the horizon:

- [ ] **Obsidian Style Toolbar:** Top-bar overlay with slide counters and navigation controls.
- [ ] **Live Interaction:** Support for selecting and copying text directly from slides.
- [ ] **Inline Previews:** Obsidian-native "Hover Preview" support (similar to how PDFs behave).
- [ ] **Slide Sorter:** A grid-view for quick navigation of large decks.

I'm a student currently navigating the academic trenches, and honestly, **Obsidian is the only reason I'm passing my classes.** I built Glint because I needed a better way to study my lecture slides without constantly switching tabs.

Hope it helps!
